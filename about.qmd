:::{#hero-heading}
For most of my early life (from childhood through part of my undergrad) I worked in construction renovating homes and eventually heavy civil. Then one day while installing moisture sensors for an irrigation system I got a spark of inspiration to change my career trajectory to computers and data. I went on to study my undergrad in Applied Statistics and Computer Science at BYU, after which I jumped right into working full-time as a software engineer. I spent a few years working on satellite software for space situational awareness for the DoD focused mostly on image processing and optimization. I currently work in cybersecurity using big-data analytics and machine learning to track down bad actors.

I consider myself an engineer with expertise in software engineering and intelligent systems focused on cyber-physical systems (IoT, software automation, AI/ML). I’m a Linux and Python native with almost 8 years of professional experience in both, but I’m language- and technology-agnostic, having learned many others over the years. I’m mostly self-taught and a hands-on, project-based learner—hence why I love doing projects. If you’d like to know more about my experience, feel free to send a message, look at my résumé, or browse my past projects.
