# Welcome to My Website  

Explore my **Projects** and **About Me** pages—this site is still evolving, with some areas complete and others under construction.  

**My vision:** I’m an engineer and builder at heart, uniting the physical and digital worlds. I design intelligent systems that optimize how we **build**, **sense**, and **connect** across cyber-physical infrastructure.
