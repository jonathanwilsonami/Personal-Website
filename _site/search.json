I currently work in cybersecurity using big-data analytics and machine learning to track down bad actors.\nI consider myself an engineer with expertise in software engineering and intelligent systems focused on cyber-physical systems (IoT, software automation, AI/ML). I’m a Linux and Python native with almost 8 years of professional experience in both, but I’m language- and technology-agnostic, having learned many others over the years. I’m mostly self-taught and a hands-on, project-based learner—hence why I love doing projects.
