**One-liner:** Interactive ridership analysis with time-of-day patterns, station flows, and anomaly spotting.

::: {.badges}
**Stack:** Python, Polars, Altair, Quarto
:::

## Overview

Brief summary of the problem, your approach, and results. Keep it tight—bullets work great:

- ETL from CSV → Parquet; fast transforms with **Polars**
- Feature engineering for weekday vs weekend patterns
- Altair charts for linked brushing across time & stations

## Code Snippet (Python)

```{python}
import polars as pl
df = pl.read_parquet("data/metro.parquet")
daily = df.group_by("date").agg(pl.col("rides").sum())
daily.head()
